- What is the difference between some() and every()? Explain these using your own words.
=>
  Difference between some() and every():
a. The `some()` and `every()` methods are used on arrays in JavaScript to check  the elements against a condition.
   The main difference between them is how they evaluate the elements.
b.`some()` returns `true` if at least one array element satisfies the condition specified by the provided callback function. 
   It stops looping through the array after finding a matching element and immediately returns "true".
   If no element satisfies the condition, it will return "false".
c. On the other hand, `every()` returns `true` only if all elements of the array satisfy the condition. 
   It loops through each element of the array and checks if the condition is met for each element. 
   If an element does not meet the condition, it immediately returns "false". 
   It only returns "true" if all elements satisfy the condition.
